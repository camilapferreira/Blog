But when I discovered it existed, I decided to dive right in this and, nowadays, Iâ€™m Product Manager at Resultados Digitais, a Saas company that provides a marketing automation platform for emerging markets.\n\nAs many other product managers, I had different experiences until shift to be a product person. I worked first at Tricae, a baby goods e-commerce business, where I learned the online marketing optimization engines. Then, I joined a Brazilian Venture Capital, Monashees, and after almost two years I decided to head back to the startup life. Now I am at Resultados Digitais.\n",
